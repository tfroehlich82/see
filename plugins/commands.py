"""Module for executing commands within the guest OS.

It depends on Requests library.

https://pypi.python.org/pypi/requests

The Agent at see/plugins/agent.py must be installed and executed
within the guest OS.

    Commands execution Hook.

    Reacts to Events sending commands to the Guest Agent.

    * Event("run_command", async=False, command="ls -al")
        Executes a simple command within the Guest OS via the Agent.
        Blocks until the results are not delivered and logs them.

    * Event("run_sample", async=True, sample="/local/path/file.exe",
            command="start {sample}")
        Uploads a sample and executes a command. The keyword {sample}
        within the command will be expanded with the path of the uploaded
        file on the Guest. The action does not wait for the results
        as the async flag is set.

    configuration::

        {
          "agent-host": "IP address of the Agent running within the Guest",
          "agent-port": 8080,
        }

    The IP address of the Agent can be, as well, communicated via an Event
    'ip_address' within the field 'address'.
